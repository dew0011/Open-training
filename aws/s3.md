## Create bucket
- Bucket names must be globally unique
- Choose a region closest to the clients that will be using it (e.g. humans, servers)
- By default all public access to the bucket is blocked (and should stay on wherever possible)
    - S3 Access Points should be used to give limited access
- object lock protects objects from being deleted (e.g.for regulatory reasons)

## File upload
- By default any AWS user or role associated with the account can access the uploaded files
    - Other AWS accounts can also be granted
    - Public access can be granted too but only if the bucket settings allow this (by default this is blocked)
- files can be allocated to a range of object storage class
    - these have different access patterns and costs
    - AWS lifecycle policies can be used to automatically transition objects to different storage classes
    - standard: for frequently accessed data
    - intelligent tiering: automatically changes object storage classes based on access frequency   
        - small monitoring fee
        - objects under 128kb will not change class or incur monitoring fees
    - Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): for rapid retrieval of infrequently accessed objects 
        - all infrequent acces storage types charge low GB storage fees but per GB retrieval fees
        - there are set minimum storage charges applied
    - One Zone-IA: Stores data in only one zone instead of the usual three
        - costs 20% than standard-IA
        - best for secondary backups
    - Glacier Instant Retrieval: lowest-cost option for data that needs rapid retrieval
        - costs 68% less than standard-IA
    - Glacier Flexible Retrieval: for data retrieved 1-2 times a year
        - 10% less than instant glacier
        - data can be retrieved in minutes to hours
    - Glacier Deep Archive: data can be restored in 12 hours

## Versioning
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html
- Disabled by default
- Allows you to recover previous versions of files
- All objects in a bucket have the same versioning policy applied
- Each version of an object in a versioned bucket will have a version ID

## Security
- block public access on buckets
- additional bucket policies (json granting specific account, roles, users specific access privileges)
- object lock to prevent deletion
- set object ownership, IAM roles

## Additional features
- Tags: allow grouping of buckets by common keys
- Logging: object-level logging or bucket access logs
    - incurs additional fees
- CloudWatch request metrics: analysis of S3 costs
- Static website hosting: For buckets hosting static websites
- Transfer acceleration: Costly but increases transfer and latency (for very large TG+ files)
- Event notifications: sets up automated notifications after an event in a bucket (e.g. create a log, mobile notification or activate a lambda function)
